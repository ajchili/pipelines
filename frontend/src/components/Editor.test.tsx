  tree.html() is used alongside mount because it allows for the HTML of the
  Editor component to be rendered and compared to a snapshot. This is required
  because the react-ace library utilizes brace which is based on vanilla HTML
  and JavaScript, without mount and tree.html() the component would not render
  the brace editor.
